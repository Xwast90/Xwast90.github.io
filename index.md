### Ahh Welcome!

This is my website, a place to display all of the work that I do throughout the semester in this class

I've been working with code for... well about the past 10 years of my life atleast starting back in highschool with html, it's always been something that I've found to be rather interesting, and I intend to keep working with it even far into the future, the most interesting thing about it for me, is watching the words and images on a page, just change into whatever I type up.
